I didn't do exercise Lesson2b, because I didn't want to register with a service I don't use. Although I understood all steps.

As of 25.01.2017, it seems that the final project isn't available anymore and won't be reactivated. At the moment you get a message that promotes Udacity's Nanodegree program: "The project Kunal describes in this video is available as part of the Full Stack Nanodegree program. It is not part of the standalone course."

I tried to collect some information about the old final projects to somehow finish the course.

Final Project Description

The final project is a place for you to demonstrate the ideas you have learned in the course while building a program that you would like to make for yourself or a friend.

If you are enrolled in the Full Course Experience, a coach will be available to help guide you through the project. You will also receive a verified certificate after successfully finishing
the final project. If you are enrolled in the Free Courseware, we would love to see the output of your final project on the discussion forum. Either way, read the instructions below to find
out more about the project.

Step 1 - Problem/Idea Definition

Begin by coming up with an idea for the project you would like to make. Here are some choices that may help in picking the idea/problem:

The project can be based on an original idea that attempts to solve a problem you care about.

You can also decide to enhance any one of the projects we have made in the course.

You may also choose to work with a module from the Python Standard Library that we havenâ€™t experimented with in the course thus far. Here are a few modules worth considering:

CSV

datetime

smtplib

re

Threading - Timer objects

Alternatively, you can choose to download and experiment with an external Python package you find interesting. Here are a few external packages worthy of your consideration:

MatplotLib

requests

Pygame

Pymedia

Deliverable

Write a 1-page document (500 words or fewer) that lists out the problem or idea for the project.

Step 2 - Solution Design

In this step you should define the steps you will need to take to design a solution for your problem statement. No code is necessary at this point. We want you to use simple English to
highlight the steps you would need to take to build the project.

Ordinarily, we would not place any restrictions on your creativity, but since this is a course about Object Oriented Programming, we want your programming solution to include creating and
instantiating new classes. In that spirit, we want you to draw any class diagrams (much like we did with class Movie, class TvShow and class Video in Lesson 3b) to explain your solution
design.You can use Google Presentation to draw this diagram.

Deliverable

Write a 1-page document (500 words or fewer) that lists the steps you would need to take to build your project. Please include class diagrams that highlight the classes and their objects you
intend to create in your program.

Step 3 - Read the Project Rubric

Go through the project rubric to make sure you understand the expectations for the project. These guidelines will be followed by the Udacity coach evaluating your project.

Step 4 - Write Code

Write code based on your solution design (Step 2) to finish your project. Feel free to ask us questions via chat or email.

Deliverable

All python programming files along with instructions on how to run your project.

Step 5 - Submit Deliverables

Once you have completed the steps above, follow the instructions below to submit your project.

If you are enrolled in the Full Course Experience, zip the following files and email them to oop-project@udacity.com. Here is some information on how to zip files on your computer.

The files to submit are

the problem definition document

the solution design document

all program files

instructions on how to run your project.

If you are enrolled in the free courseware, please submit screenshots of the output of your program to the following discussion forum
